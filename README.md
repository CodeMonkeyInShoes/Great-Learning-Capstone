# Great-Learning-Capstone
This is a collection of submission materials for my capsstone project in the Applied Data Science program through Great Learning. This project was to create a deep learning solution that could classify the emotion conveyed by a grayscale image of a human face into one of four categories: happy, sad, neutral, and surprise. The dataset consists of roughly 32k, 32x32, grayscale images. Provided here are an html document containing the output from the Google Colab nodebook and the PDF of my final report.
